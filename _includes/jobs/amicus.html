    <div class="about">
        Having grown out of the Yale Entrepreneurial Society after winning the
        Yale Venture Challenge, <a href="http://amicushq.com/">Amicus</a> is a
        well-funded NYC startup that helps
        nonprofits and universities raise more money, attract more members, and
        win more votes. It does this by making it fun and easy for a supporter
        of a nonprofit to reach out to their friends, family, and neighbors on
        behalf of a cause they care about. A social good for-profit startup,
        Amicus believes purpose and profit should go hand in hand.
